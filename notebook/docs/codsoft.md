CodSoft is also a fake company on Linkedin which hires people as interns. The newbies feel that they are excited but their cover letter is also automated, their whole hiring process is automated and everything. Their tasks are just automated provided on a pdf or sheet to perform and it's useless to do internship if you are a newbie. Here are some comments from users in Reddit:
