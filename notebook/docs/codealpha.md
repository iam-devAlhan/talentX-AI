Same like Codsoft, CodeAlpha is also a fake company on Linkedin that hires, it has also an automated process like tasks, hiring etc all stuff.

# Here is the Reddit post of a user:
i have enrolled in a CodeAlpha internship and after knowing it's usless and a scam (before having the certificate) i decided to stop should i keep the projects that i did during the internship or delete them?
