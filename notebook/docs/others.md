Like GaoTek, CodeAlpha, Codsoft, other internships such as CodeVeda, Cognifyz Solutions, Rayonix Solutions are fake companies on Linkedin. People should avoid to get hired as intern as there because it is time wasting and certificate has no industry value.

# Here are the most red flags you will see in these and others:
1. They will ask some basic questions.
2. They might offer unpaid or paid without reasonable amount.
3. They might offer job after internship permanently which is often fake.
4. They might want processing fee for internship, remember any kind of internship doesn't want fees.
5. They don't have website on their Linkedin
6. They might have registered fake LLC in US, UK, Canada, and other parts of Europe.
7. Mostly fake internships are found in India and rate of the fake internships is higher.
8. They might post to join your team on Linkedin by liking the post and comment "interested" to gain reach on Linkedin.
9. HRs may ghost (leaving no reply of rejection or approval email or phone call) after successful interviews, maybe they have actually hired someone before you and interviews were arranged for just formality.
